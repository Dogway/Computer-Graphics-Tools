# Blender Scripts

Here I include free of charge "UOZA - Selection Pie" (also in the [gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/BceiW) download) since it is more or less a mod from Wazou's Selection and Active Tool Pie Menus, and the integration of the 3 operators from ["UOZA Production Pies"](https://gumroad.com/l/BceiW) to the following free addons:

- Force Autosave: [MACHIN3tools](https://gumroad.com/l/MACHIN3tools) Save Pie Menu
- Apply Delta: [Wazou](https://gumroad.com/l/wazou_pie_menus)'s Origin Pie Menu
- Origin to Selected: [Wazou](https://gumroad.com/l/wazou_pie_menus)'s Apply Pie Menu
