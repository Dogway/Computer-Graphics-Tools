# AStats

Mod of [AStats](https://github.com/YuriyAndropov/blenderPython/blob/master/AStats.py) addon for Blender from [YuriyAndropov](https://github.com/YuriyAndropov). It's a polygon count (and few other data) overlay in the viewport, so you can disable the bottom bar.

I rearranged and aligned the overlay so it's more organised. Beautified the code, added commited Memory (with help from gorion103), and justified to top-left corner so placement is more robust when using multiple viewports and performance benefits.
