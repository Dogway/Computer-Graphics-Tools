# AStats

Mod of [AStats](https://github.com/YuriyAndropov/blenderPython/blob/master/AStats.py) addon for Blender from [YuriyAndropov](https://github.com/YuriyAndropov). It's a polygon count (and some other stats) overlay in the viewport so you can hide the bottom bar for extra workspace.

I rearranged and aligned the overlay to make it more structured. Beautified the code, added commited Memory (with gorion103's help), and justified to top-left corner so relative placement is more robust when using multiple viewports and also for performance reasons.
