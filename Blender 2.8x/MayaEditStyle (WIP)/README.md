# Maya Style Component Pie Menu

I decided to try to mimic Maya style selection, that is, instead of 3 steps; *Exit Edit Mode, Select Object, Enter Edit Mode*, do it in only one; fling mouse to one side in Pie Menu (Vertex,Edge,Face,Object) and directly enter into Edit Mode of **object under the cursor**.
Looks like the *ray_cast operator* is not as robust so selection is very erratic.
