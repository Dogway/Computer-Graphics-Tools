# Blender Scripts

Here I include the free "UOZA - Selection Pie" (also in the gumroad download) since it is more or less a mod from Wazou's Selection and Active Tool Pie Menus, and the integration of my 3 operators in "UOZA Production Pies".

- Force Autosave: MACHIN3tools Save Pie Menu
- Apply Delta: Wazou's Origin Pie Menu
- Origin to Selected: Wazou's Apply Pie Menu
