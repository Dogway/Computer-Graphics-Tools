# BruteForce TextureBaking

This [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C__2GQaTtcs) will explain the benefits of building shader trees in you default rendering application and also what problems can arise due to that (moir√©e, roughness variation, performance hit). Following a solution is provided with custom MEL scripts to streamline the process.


To add the scripts, open the Script Editor and paste the content of the Script, select all and MMB+Drag to the shelf.
Now you can add a name and icons as depicted below if you wish:

**Unfold MESH mod.mel (Nyro's script mod):**
